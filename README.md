# Digital Implementations using Tiny FPGA Bx board

## Project 1: PWM Generator
### AIM 
To create a PWM using an FPGA and implementation using Verilog

### Hardware Used
1. Tiny FPGA Bx board
2. Servo motor

### Working
1. Pin 13 is programmed as output
2. Output is 1 based on value of counter and its comparison with duty cycle value
